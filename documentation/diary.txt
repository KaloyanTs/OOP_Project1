    period FROM/TO -> determines activity of reservation
    // ctor/dtor to be friends of room   ??



    Room
    number and bedCount
    can be free or taken (!free)

    HotelBuilding
    vector of rooms
    method requestRoom(const Reservation &res,room )

    RoomAnalyzer
    <<<static suggest(const HotelBuilding &hB, unsigned beds, Date from, Date to)>>>
    given reserver's info (beds, period->availability) and //to calculate some score for each room
    shows top 5 most suitable rooms
    returns pointer to chosen room
